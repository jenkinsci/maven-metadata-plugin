  This parameter allows the resolution of maven artifact versions by contacting the repository and reading the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Repository+Metadata">maven-metadata.xml</a>.
  <p/>
  If you named your parameter "MY_JAR" and have configured all values correctly. Then the following parameters will be set for the build step:
  <ul>
    <li>MY_JAR_VERSION - the version you selected in the dropdown or that was selected as part of an automated build</li>
    <li>MY_JAR_ARTIFACT_URL - the full URL to the actual artifact selected. You can use something like "wget" to download that artifact and do something with it.</li>
    <li>MY_JAR_GROUP_ID - echoes back your configuration</li>
    <li>MY_JAR_ARTIFACT_ID - echoes back your configuration</li>
    <li>MY_JAR_CLASSIFIER - echoes back your configuration</li>
    <li>MY_JAR_PACKAGING - echoes back your configuration</li>
  </ul>
